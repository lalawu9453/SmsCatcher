### [BUG] Scraper for receive-smss.com is failing to parse

**Description:**
The scraper for `https://receive-smss.com/` is currently unable to correctly parse phone numbers from the page.

**Details:**
*   The site appears to have strong anti-bot mechanisms (possibly Cloudflare), which frequently cause `Selenium` to time out or fail while waiting for elements to load.
*   Even when the page occasionally loads successfully, the existing parsing logic for the number list may be outdated due to site structure changes.

**Priority:**
*   **Low**

**Reasoning:**
*   Observation shows that this site provides a relatively small number of active phone numbers.
*   The effort required to fix its anti-bot issues is high compared to the benefit, making it a low priority.
*   For now, we can focus on maintaining other, more stable sources with more numbers.
